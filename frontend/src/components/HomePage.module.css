The CSS module styling for the component is as follows:

```css
/* HomePage.module.css */

.home {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
    padding: 20px;
}

.home h1 {
    font-size: 2.5em;
    color: #333;
}

.home p {
    font-size: 1.2em;
    color: #666;
}
```

Here's what each style rule does:

- `.home`: This rule applies to the main div in the HomePage component. It makes the div take up the full width and height of the viewport (`100%` width and `100vh` height). The `display: flex`, `flex-direction: column`, `align-items: center`, and `justify-content: center` properties center the div's children both horizontally and vertically. The `text-align: center` property centers the text within the div. The `background-color` is a light gray, and `padding: 20px` adds some space around the div's content.

- `.home h1`: This rule applies to the h1 tag in the HomePage component. It sets the font size to `2.5em`, which is 2.5 times the size of the base font. The color of the text is a dark gray (`#333`).

- `.home p`: This rule applies to the p tag in the HomePage component. It sets the font size to `1.2em`, which is 1.2 times the size of the base font. The color of the text is a medium gray (`#666`).
