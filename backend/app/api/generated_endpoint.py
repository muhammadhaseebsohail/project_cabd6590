Setting up a testing suite for a backend application involves creating tests at different levels (unit tests, integration tests) to ensure the application works as expected. With FastAPI, we use Pytest for our testing needs.

Firstly, we need to install pytest and httpx for making HTTP requests in our tests. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install pytest httpx
```

Here's an example of how you can structure your tests:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

```python
# test_main.py
from starlette.testclient import TestClient

from main import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_read_root():
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"Hello": "World"}
```

In this test, we are testing the root endpoint ("/"). We make a GET request to the endpoint and then check if the response status code is 200 and if the response body is {"Hello": "World"}.

For more complex tests involving databases or other external services, you might need to mock those services. You can use libraries such as unittest.mock for that.

For integration tests, it's a good practice to separate them from unit tests and run them in a different environment or under different conditions.

If you have multiple tests, you can run them all by using the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

This will discover all the files that start with test_ or end with _test and run them.

Remember, testing is an essential part of software development. Good tests can help you catch bugs early, make your code more robust, and speed up the development process.
