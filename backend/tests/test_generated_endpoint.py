Here's a comprehensive suite of tests for your FastAPI application:

```python
# tests/test_main.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from main import app

client = TestClient(app)

# Test for success case
def test_read_root():
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"Hello": "World"}

# Test for error case (non-existing endpoint)
def test_read_non_existing():
    response = client.get("/non-existing")
    assert response.status_code == 404

# Test for data validation (assuming you have an endpoint that accepts POST and expects certain data)
def test_create_item():
    response = client.post("/items/", json={})
    assert response.status_code == 422  # HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity, not valid data

    response = client.post("/items/", json={"name": "new item", "value": 10})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"name": "new item", "value": 10}

# Test for edge case (assuming you have an endpoint that accepts GET and expects certain query parameters)
def test_get_item():
    response = client.get("/items/1")
    assert response.status_code == 404  # HTTP 404 Not Found, no item with id=1

    response = client.get("/items/99999999999999999999")
    assert response.status_code == 404  # HTTP 404 Not Found, no item with id=99999999999999999999
```

Remember to substitute the real endpoints and data models of your FastAPI application in the test code above. Run the tests with `pytest` in your terminal.

```bash
pytest
```

This will run all tests in your test directory. If your tests are spread across multiple files, pytest will automatically discover and run them.

The above example tests include:
- A successful GET request to the root ("/") endpoint.
- An unsuccessful GET request to a non-existing ("/non-existing") endpoint.
- Data validation tests where a POST request is made to the ("/items/") endpoint with both invalid and valid data.
- Edge cases where a GET request is made to the ("/items/{id}") endpoint with non-existing `id` values.
